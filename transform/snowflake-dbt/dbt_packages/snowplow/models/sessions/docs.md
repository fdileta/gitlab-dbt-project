# Snowplow Sessions
{% docs snowplow_sessions %}

Sessions are discrete periods of activity by a user on a website. In Snowplow, a session is typically defined as a series of activities followed by a 30-minute window without any activity. If the same cookie visits the website after 30 minutes of inactivity, the javascript tracker will start a new session.

The Snowplow sessionization models _do not_ need to handle the determination of when to start a new session; that is handled in the Snowplow javascript tracker and saved in the `session_id` dimension of the event. The sessionization models build a `snowplow_sessions` model that aggregates a large number data points about the `session_id` that has been generated by the javascript tracker. Most of this information is calculated on top of page views from `snowplow_page_views`.

Note that the `inferred_user_id` field should be used as the primary user identifier in this model, as it has had "identity stitching" performed on it and can therefore reliably trace a user's history through time and across browsers/devices.

Please view the [Snowplow Canonical Web Data Model](https://github.com/snowplow/web-data-model#32-sessions-table) for more information on this model.
