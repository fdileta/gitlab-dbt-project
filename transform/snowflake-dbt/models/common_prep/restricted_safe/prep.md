 Prep table for the mapping table for subscriptions to opportunities. This incorporates logic from previous processes which includes taking opportunity-subscription connections from quotes, invoices, and the subscription object itself. Based on the created date, term dates, or subscription name, we fill in missing opportunity ids.

 The process is described in this [flow diagram](https://lucid.app/lucidchart/e7661694-61ed-4317-b648-d054be9aff0e/edit?viewport_loc=-76%2C296%2C3590%2C1856%2C0_0&invitationId=inv_f50ea2e1-1ea8-47ca-b950-75b723273b00)

 The final result yields the distinct combination of subscriptions and opportunities with the best match based on the rules defined in the flow diagram.

 For self-service subscriptions:
 - Take the opportunity_id from the subscription object
 - Using the quote_number from the subscription's invoice, get the opportunity_id from the opportunity which has that quote_number on it.
 - Out of all quotes, take any opportunity_id where the quote has the subscription_id on it.
 - Fill forward/backwards when the subscription created dates are the same.
 - Fill forward/backwards when the subscription term dates are the same.
 - Fill forward when the subscription name is the same.

 For sales-assisted subscriptions:
 - Take the opportunity_id from the subscription object if it was created after 2021-04-11. This is when automation was set up to reliably relate subscriptions and opportunities.
 - Using the quote_number from the subscription object, get the opportunity_id from the opportunity which has that quote_number on it.
 - Using the quote_number from the subscription's invoice, get the opportunity_id from the opportunity which has that quote_number on it.
 - Out of all quotes, take any opportunity_id where the quote has the subscription_id on it.
 - Fill forward/backwards when the subscription created dates are the same.
 - Fill forward/backwards when the subscription term dates are the same.
 - Fill forward when the subscription name is the same.

 In both cases there where multiple opportunities are assigned to a single subscription. This can be caused by a variety of reasons, and we apply the following logic to all subscriptions to determine which opportunity is the best match:
 - Select the opportunity whith the amount that matches the amount on the subscription's invoice. This is the best solution for when a subscription is one of many on an invoice, and we need to match up each subscription with the appropriate opportunity.
 - Select the opportunity created first if all of the possible opportunities' amounts sums to the amount on the subscription's invoices. This is the best solution for when a subscription is billed on multiple invoices and new opportunity is created for each invoice. Ex. Ramp deals
 - If the subscription is self-service and has an opportunity_id on the subscription object, take the opportunity_id from the subscription object.
 - If the subscription is sales_assisted and there is a quote_number on the subscription, take the opportunity_id from the opportunity associated with this quote_number.
 - If all of the methods for finding an opportunity-subscription mapping match for one record, select this subscription-opportunity pair.
