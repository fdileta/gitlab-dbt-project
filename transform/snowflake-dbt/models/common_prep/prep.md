dim_plan_id column: 

Assumes if dim_plan_id is null that it is a free plan, plan id 34. Also, accounts for gold/ultimate plans in the past that did not have a trial plan id or trial name. The logic checks for plan names that are ultimate/gold AND have trial set to true and conforms them to plan id 102 which is the ultimate trial plan. After a trial expires, it is moved to a free plan, plan id 34. Therefore, after accounting for the gold/ultimate plans that had trial = TRUE, we can rely on the plan id and plan name out of the subscription and plan source tables to identify trials. The ultimate_trial plan name is plan id 102 and the premium_trial plan name is plan id 103. In a future iteration, this plan information should be conformed with the dim_product_tier dimension to have a single source of truth for plan information at GitLab.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs prep_subscription_lineage_intermediate %}

The `zuora_subs` CTE de-duplicates Zuora subscriptions. Zuora keeps track of different versions of a subscription via the field "version". However, it's possible for there to be multiple version of a single Zuora version. The data with account_id = '2c92a0fc55a0dc530155c01a026806bd' in the base zuora_subscription table exemplifies this. There are multiple rows with a version of 4. The CTE adds a row number based on the updated_date where a value of 1 means it's the newest version of that version. It also filters subscriptions down to those that have either "Active" or "Cancelled" statuses since those are the only ones that we care about.

The `renewal_subs` CTE creates a lookup table for renewal subscriptions, their parent, and the earliest contract start date. The `contract_effective_date` field was found to be the best identifier for a subscriptions cohort, hence why we're finding the earliest relevant one here. The renewal_row is generated because there are instances where multiple subscriptions point to the same renewal. We generally will want the oldest one for info like cohort date.

The final select statement creates a new field specifically for counting subscriptions and generates appropriate cohort dates. Because we want to count renewal subscriptions as part of their parent, we have the slug for counting so that we don't artificially inflate numbers. It also pickes the most recent version of a subscription.

The subscription_end_month calculation is taken as the previous month for a few reasons. Technically, on Zuora's side, the effective end date stored in the database the day _after_ the subscription ended. (More info here https://community.zuora.com/t5/Subscriptions/How-to-get-ALL-the-products-per-active-subscription/td-p/2224) By subtracting the month, we're guaranteed to get the correct month for an end date. If in the DB it ends 7/31, then in reality that is the day before and is therefore not in effect for the month of July (because it has to be in effect on the last day to be in force for that month). If the end date is 8/1, then it is in effect for the month of July and we're making the proper calculation.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs prep_subscription_lineage %}

Connects a subscription to all of the subscriptions in its lineage. To understand more about a subscription's relationship to others, please see [the handbook under Zuora Subscription Data Management](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/finance/accounting/)

The `flattening` CTE flattens the intermediate model based on the array in the renewal slug field set in the base subscription model. Lineage is initially set here as the values in the parent slug and any renewal slugs. The OUTER => TRUE setting is like doing an outer join and will return rows even if the renewal slug is null.  

The recursive CTE function generate the full lineage. The anchor query pulls from the flattening CTE and sets up the initial lineage. If there is a renewal subscription then it will continue to the next part of the CTE, but if there are no renewals then the recursive clause will return no additional results.

The recursive clause joins the renewal slug from the anchor clause to the subscription slug of the next iteration of the recursive clause. We're keeping track of the parent slug as the "root" for the initial recursion (this is the "ultimate parent" of the lineage). Within the recursive clause we're checking if there are any further renewals before setting the child count.

The next CTE takes the full union of the results and finds the longest lineage for every parent slug based on the children_count. This CTE is overexpressive and could most likely be simplified with the deduplication CTE. The final dedupe CTE returns a single value for every root and it's full downstream lineage.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs prep_subscription_lineage_parentage_start %}
This is the first part of a two-part model. (It is in two parts because of memory constraints.)

The `flattened` CTE takes the data from lineage, which starts in the following state:


|SUBSCRIPTION_NAME_SLUGIFY|LINEAGE|
|:-:|:-:|
|a-s00011816|a-s00011817,a-s00011818|
|a-s00011817|a-s00011818|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011816,a-s00011817,a-s00011818|


This flattens them to be be in one-per row. Rxample:

|SUBSCRIPTION_NAME_SLUGIFY|SUBSCRIPTIONS_IN_LINEAGE|CHILD_INDEX|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|a-s00011817|a-s00011818|0|
|a-s00011816|a-s00011817|0|
|a-s00011816|a-s00011818|1|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011816|0|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011817|1|

Then we identify the version of the `subscriptions_in_lineage` with the max depth (in the `find_max_depth` CTE) and join it to the `flattened` CTE in the `with_parents` CTE. This allows us to identify the ultimate parent subscription in any given subscription.

For this series of subscriptions, the transformation result is:

|ULTIMATE_PARENT_SUB|CHILD_SUB|DEPTH|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011816|0|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011817|1|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011818|2|

Of note here is that parent accounts _only_ appear in the parents column. `a-s00003063` does not appear linked to itself. (We correct for this in `subscriptions_xf` when introducing the `subscription_slug_for_counting` value and coalescing it with the slug.)

In the final CTE `finalish`, we join to intermediate to retreive the cohort dates before joining to `subscription_intermediate` in `subscription_xf`.

The end result of those same subscriptions:

|ULTIMATE_PARENT_SUB|CHILD_SUB|COHORT_MONTH|COHORT_QUARTER|COHORT_YEAR|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011816|2014-08-01|2014-07-01|2014-01-01|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011817|2014-08-01|2014-07-01|2014-01-01|
|a-s00003063|a-s00011818|2014-08-01|2014-07-01|2014-01-01|

This transformation process does not handle the consolidation of subscriptions, though, which is what `zuora_subscription_parentage_finish` picks up.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs prep_subscription_lineage_parentage_finish %}

This is the second part of a two-part model. (It is in two parts because of memory constraints.) For the first part, please checkout the docs for zuora_subscription_parentage_start.

Some accounts are not a direct renewal, they are the consolidation of many subscriptions into one. While the lineage model is build to accomodate these well, simply flattening the model produces one parent for many children accounts, for example:

|ULTIMATE_PARENT_SUB|CHILD_SUB|COHORT_MONTH|COHORT_QUARTER|COHORT_YEAR|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|a-s00003114|a-s00005209|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|
|a-s00003873|a-s00005209|2017-01-01|2017-01-01|2017-01-01|

Since the whole point of ultimate parent is to understand cohorts, this poses a problem (not just for fan outs when joining) because it is inaccurate.

The `new_base` CTE identifies all affected subscriptions, while `consolidated_parents` and `deduped_parents` find the oldest version of the subscription.

This produces

|ULTIMATE_PARENT_SUB|CHILD_SUB|COHORT_MONTH|COHORT_QUARTER|COHORT_YEAR|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|a-s00003114|a-s00005209|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|

but drops the subscriptions that are not the ultimate parent but had not previously been identified as children, in this case `a-s00003873`.

The first part of the `unioned` CTE isolates these subscriptions, naming them children of the newly-minted ultimate parent subscription (really just the oldest in a collection of related subscriptions), producing

|ULTIMATE_PARENT_SUB|CHILD_SUB|COHORT_MONTH|COHORT_QUARTER|COHORT_YEAR|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|a-s00003114|a-s00003873|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|
|a-s00003114|a-s00003873|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|


It unions this to the results of `deduped_consolidations` and all original base table where the subscriptions were not affected by consolidations. Finally we deduplicate one more time.  

The final result:

|ULTIMATE_PARENT_SUB|CHILD_SUB|COHORT_MONTH|COHORT_QUARTER|COHORT_YEAR|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|a-s00003114|a-s00009998|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|
|a-s00003114|a-s00003873|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|
|a-s00003114|a-s00005209|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|2016-01-01|

* Compare this data point with the one received one month before, we have 3 scenarios:
  * data from month M > data from month M-1: the monthly proxied metric is data(M) - data(M-1)
  * no data for month M-1: then monthly proxied metric is data(M)

Usage ping's data is stored in several nested jsons as shown in [this page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/telemetry/usage_ping.html#example-usage-ping-payload).

Those metrics sent could be of various types:
* all_time counters (for example how many issues a specific instance has created since its inception)
* 28_days counters (how many users have created at least one issue over the last 4 weeks)
* 7_days counters (how many users have created at least one issue over the last 7 days)
* an instance configuration parameter (has this instance enabled saml/sso)

This model extracts the 7-days counters (based on the mapping table in this spreadsheet) and flattens the json.

The models transforms this json:

{% docs prep_usage_data_28_days_flattened %}

The granularity of this model is one row per tuple (metric_name, instance_id).

Usage ping's data is stored in several nested jsons as shown in [this page](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/telemetry/usage_ping.html#example-usage-ping-payload).

Those metrics sent could be of various types:
* all_time counters (for example how many issues a specific instance has created since its inception)
* 7_days counters (how many users have created at least one issue over the last 4 weeks)
* an instance configuration parameter (has this instance enabled saml/sso)

This model extracts the 28-days counters (based on the mapping table in this spreadsheet) and flattens the json.

The models transforms this json:

```
