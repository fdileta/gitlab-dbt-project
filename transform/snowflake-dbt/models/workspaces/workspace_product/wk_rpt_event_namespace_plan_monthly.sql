Look for a namespace's last event within a calendar month.
The plan on the final event will be used to attribute the namespace's usage during the month.
This is the same logic used in rpt_event_xmau_metric_monthly and rpt_event_plan_monthly, but
expanded to look at the entire calendar month instead of the last 28 days.
A flag will be added below to allow filtering based on the reporting period.
