{% docs subscription_product_usage_data %}

This model collates a variety of product usage data metrics at the subscription_id granularity for both self-managed and SaaS subscriptions. Detailed documentation on the creation of this model, constraints, and example queries can be found on the [Master Subscription Product Usage Data Process Dashboard](https://app.periscopedata.com/app/gitlab/686439/Master-Subscription-Product-Usage-Data-Process).

{% docs mart_product_usage_wave_1_3_metrics_monthly_diff %}

The purpose of this mart table is to act as a data pump of the `_all_time_event` Usage Ping metrics at a _monthly grain_ into Gainsight for Customer Product Insights (`_all_time_user` columns are not included). To accomplish this goal, this model includes a column that takes the _diff_ erences in `_all_time_event` values between consecutive monthly Usage Pings. Since some months do not contain Usage Ping data, these _diff_ erences are normalized (estimated) to a monthly value based on the average daily value over the time between pings multiplied by the days in the calendar month(s) between the consecutive pings.

{% docs mart_product_usage_paid_user_metrics_monthly %}
This table unions the sets of all Self-Managed and SaaS **paid users**. The data from this table will be used for Customer Product Insights.

The grain of this table is subscription per namespace || uuid-hostname per month.

The join to `dim_subscription_snapshot_bottom_up` uses a datediff of -1 day so that the `subscription_status` reflects the position at the end of the previous month. This avoids the situation where a subscription expires on the last day of the month and new one begins on the 1st of the next month meaning the join produces a NULL.
