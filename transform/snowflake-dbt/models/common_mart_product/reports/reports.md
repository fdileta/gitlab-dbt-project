{% docs rpt_event_xmau_metric_monthly %}

**Description:** GitLab.com Usage Event Report Data with Monthly Totals for Valid Free and Paid Events for User Type Events that are Used in xMAU Metrics
- [Targets and Actions](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/events.html) activity by Users and [Namespaces](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/business-technology/data-team/data-catalog/namespace/) within the GitLab.com application are captured and refreshed periodically throughout the day.  Targets are objects ie. issue, milestone, merge_request and Actions have effect on Targets, ie. approved, closed, commented, created, etc.  

**Data Grain:**
- event_calendar_month
- user_group
- section_name
- stage_name
- group_name (plan_was_paid_at_event_date)

**Filters:**
- Use Valid Events Only for standard analysis and reporting:
  - Remove Events where the Event Created Datetime < the User Created Datetime.
    - These are usually events from projects that were created before the User and then imported in by the User after the User is created.  
  - Keep Events where User Id = NULL.  These do not point to a particular User, ie. 'milestones' 
  - Remove Events from blocked users
- Rolling 24mos of Data
- Include rows where the Event_Date is within 28 days of the Last Day of the Month
- Include User Type Events 
- Include Events used in Metrics (umau, gmau, smau)  

**Business Logic in this Model:** 
- Valid events where the Event Create DateTime is >= User Create DateTime
- Events from blocked users are excluded
- Aggregated Counts are based on the Event Date being within the Last Day of the Month and 27 days prior to the Last Day of the Month (total 28 days)
  - Events that are 29,30 or 31 days prior to the Last Day of the Month will Not be included in these totals
  - This is intended to match the instance-level service ping metrics by getting a 28-day count
- The Last Plan Id of the Month for the Namespace is used for the Calculations and Reporting.

**Other Comments:**
- Note about the `action` event: This "event" captures everything from the [Events API](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/events.html) - issue comments, MRs created, etc. While the `action` event is mapped to the Manage stage, the events included actually span multiple stages (plan, create, etc), which is why this is used for UMAU. Be mindful of the impact of including `action` during stage adoption analysis.

{% docs rpt_ping_metric_first_last_versions %}

**Description:**  First and Last Versions for Ping Metrics by Edition and Prerelease
- This table provides First and Last Application Versions along with Installation Counts by Metric, Ping Edition and Prerelease.    

**Data Grain:**
- metrics_path

- version_is_prerelease

**Filters:**
- Metrics from GitLab Service Pings will not be considered
- `Forwarded` - Only 28 Day and All-Time metrics  
- `Forwarded` - Only Metrics from the 'Last Ping of the Month' pings 

**Business Logic in this Model:** 
- `First Versions` - The earliest version found for each Metrics_Path, Ping_Edition and Version_Is_Prerelease 
- `Last Versions` - The latest version found for each Metrics_Path, Ping_Edition and Version_Is_Prerelease 
- `is_last_ping_of_month` = last ping (Instance_id and Host_id) sent for the Month
- `major_minor_version` = major_version || '.' || minor_version 
- `major_minor_version_id` = major_version * 100 + minor_version
- `version_is_prerelease` = version LIKE '%-pre'

**Other Comments:**
- Service Ping data is Sums, Counts and Percents of Usage (called metrics) along with the Server Instance Configuration information is collected at a point in time for each Instance and sent to GitLab Corporate.  This is normally done on a weekly basis.  The Instance Owner determines whether this data will be sent or not and how much will be sent.  Implementations can be Customer Hosted (Self-Managed) or GitLab Hosted (referred to as SaaS or Dotcom data).  Multiple Instances can be hosted on Self-Managed Implementations like GitLab Implementations.
