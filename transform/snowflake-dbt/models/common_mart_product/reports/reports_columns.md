{% docs user_group %}

Type of user based on the ultimate parent namespace's plan on the last event of the month (total, free, paid). Trial namespaces are considered to be free

{% enddocs %}

Array containing the event_names included in the xMAU metric

{% enddocs %}

{% docs plan_id_at_event_month %}

The ID of the ultimate parent namespace's plan on the month the event was created (ex. 34, 100, 101, etc). If multiple plans are available during the month, this reflects the last available plan for the namespace. Defaults to '34' (free) if a value is not available

The last (maximum/most recent) major_minor_version_id that sent a ping containing the metric

{% enddocs %}

{% docs last_major_minor_version_with_counter %}

The last (maximum/most recent) major_minor_version that sent a ping containing the metric, easily joined to `dim_gitlab_releases`

{% enddocs %}

{% enddocs %}

{% docs dim_installation_count %}

A count of installations (`COUNT(DISTINCT dim_installation_id)`) that ever sent a ping containing the metric

{% enddocs %}

{% docs licensed_user_count_rpt_model %}

Count of licensed users (seats) associated with the subscription, calculated using `fct_charge`

{% enddocs %}

{% docs ping_count %}

The count of pings sent by the installation that month

{% enddocs %}

{% docs has_sent_pings %}

Boolean flag set to True if installation sent at least 1 ping that month

{% enddocs %}

{% docs is_missing_charge_subscription %}

Boolean flag set to True if a ping associated with the subscription was received during the month, but there is not a corresponding record in `fct_charge`. This can be True in cases of delayed renewals, etc.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs reporting_count_estimation_model %}

The number of subscriptions or seats that meet the condition described in the estimation_grain. This is either a subscription reporting a metric or a subscription sending a ping from a version with that metric.

Examples: 
- If `estimation_grain = 'metric/version check - subscription based estimation'`, then this is a count of subscriptions that sent a ping from a version with the metric instrumented
- If `estimation_grain = 'reported metric - seat based estimation'`, then this is a count of seats that reported the metric

{% enddocs %}

{% docs not_reporting_count_estimation_model %}

The number of subscriptions or seats that meet the condition described in the estimation_grain. This is either a subscription not sending a ping that month, not sending that particular metric, or sending a ping from a version without that metric (ex. an older version). This is defined as `total_count - reporting_count`

Examples: 
- If `estimation_grain = 'metric/version check - subscription based estimation'`, then this is a count of subscriptions that sent a ping from a version with the metric instrumented (they could be opted out of sending Service Ping or on an older version)
- If `estimation_grain = 'reported metric - seat based estimation'`, then this is a count of seats that did not report the metric (they could be opted out of sending Service Ping, on an older version, or opted out of sending optional metrics)

{% enddocs %}

{% docs total_count_estimation_model %}

The total number of active subscriptions or seats that month, based on the estimation_grain.

Examples:
- If `estimation_grain = 'metric/version check - subscription based estimation'`, then this is a count of active subscriptions that month
- If `estimation_grain = 'reported metric - seat based estimation'`, then this is a count of seats associated with active subscriptions that month

{% enddocs %}

{% docs percent_reporting_estimation_model %}

The percent of total subscriptions or seats that meet the condition described in the estimation_grain. This is calculated using the [`pct_w_counters` macro](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.pct_w_counters) and is defined as `reporting_count / (reporting_count + not_reporting_count)`

{% enddocs %}

{% docs estimation_grain %}

The estimation methodology being used. **The "official" methodology used for xMAU/PI reporting is "metric/version check - subscription based estimation".** This value provides the context to understand `total_count`, `reporting_count`, `not_reporting_count`, and `percent_reporting`. 

estimation_grain is made up of two components: a condition and a measure (`condition - measure`). There are two conditions, `metric_version_check` (whether a subscription sent a ping from a version of GitLab with the metric instrumented) and `reported_metric` (whether a subscription reported the metric), and two measures `subscription based` (count of subscriptions) and `seat based` (count of seats).

Examples:
- `estimation_grain = 'metric/version check - subscription based estimation'`: This is a methodology based on the count of subscriptions that sent a ping from on a version with the metric instrumented
- `estimation_grain = 'reported metric - seat based estimation'`: This methodology is based on the count of seats that reported the metric

{% enddocs %}

{% docs total_usage_with_estimate %}

Total usage, including the estimate. This is calculated using the [`usage_estimation` macro](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/macro/macro.gitlab_snowflake.usage_estimation).

{% enddocs %}

{% docs estimated_usage %}

Estimated usage based on recorded usage and estimation grain/methodology. This is defined as `total_usage_with_estimate - recorded_usage`.

{% enddocs %}

{% docs recorded_usage_estimation_model %}

Actual recorded usage

{% enddocs %}

{% docs total_subscription_count_on_versions %}

Count of subscriptions sending a ping from a version of GitLab with the metric instrumented

{% enddocs %}

{% docs total_licensed_users_on_versions %}

Count of licensed users (seats) associated with subscriptions sending a ping from a version of GitLab with the metric instrumented
